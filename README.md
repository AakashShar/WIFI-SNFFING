wireless sniffing
wireless network is a set of two or more devices connected with each other via radio waves within a limited space range. The devices in a wireless network have the freedom to be in motion, but be in connection with the network and share data with other devices in the network. One of the most crucial point that they are so spread is that their installation cost is very cheap and fast than the wire networks.

Wireless networks are widely used and it is quite easy to set them up. They use IEEE 802.11 standards. A wireless router is the most important device in a wireless network that connects the users with the Internet.

In a wireless network, we have Access Points which are extensions of wireless ranges that behave as logical switches.

Although wireless networks offer great flexibility, they have their security problems. A hacker can sniff the network packets without having to be in the same building where the network is located. As wireless networks communicate through radio waves, a hacker can easily sniff the network from a nearby location.

Most attackers use network sniffing to find the SSID and hack a wireless network. When our wireless cards are converted in sniffing modes, they are called monitor mode.

Kismet
Kismet is a powerful tool for wireless sniffing that is found in Kali distribution. It can also be downloaded from its official webpage − https://www.kismetwireless.net

Let’s see how it works. First of all, open a terminal and type kismet. Start the Kismet Server and click Yes, as shown in the following screenshot.

As shown here, click the Start button.

Now, Kismet will start to capture data. The following screenshot shows how it would appear −

NetStumbler
NetStumbler is another tool for wireless hacking that is primarily meant for Windows systems. It can be downloaded from http://www.stumbler.net/

It is quite easy to use NetStumbler on your system. You just have to click the Scanning button and wait for the result, as shown in the following screenshot.

It should display a screenshot as follows −

It is important to note that your card should support monitoring mode, otherwise you will fail to monitor.

Wired Equivalent Privacy
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is a security protocol that was invented to secure wireless networks and keep them private. It utilizes encryption at the data link layer which forbids unauthorized access to the network.

The key is used to encrypt the packets before transmission begins. An integrity check mechanism checks that the packets are not altered after transmission.

Note that WEP is not entirely immune to security problems. It suffers from the following issues −

• CRC32 is not sufficient to ensure complete cryptographic integrity of a packet.

• It is vulnerable to dictionary attacks.

• WEP is vulnerable to Denial of Services attacks too.

WEPcrack
WEPcrack is a popular tool to crack WEP passwords. It can be downloaded from − https://sourceforge.net/projects/wepcrack/

Aircrack-ng
Aircrak-ng is another popular tool for cracking WEP passwords. It can be found in the Kali distribution of Linux.

The following screenshot shows how we have sniffed a wireless network and collected packets and created a file RHAWEP-01.cap. Then we run it with aircrack-ng to decrypt the cypher.

Wireless DoS Attacks
In a wireless environment, an attacker can attack a network from a distance and therefore, it is sometimes difficult to collect evidences against the attacker.

The first type of DoS is Physical Attack. This type of attack is very basic and it is in the base of radio interferences which can be created even from cordless phones that operate in 2.4 GHz range.

Another type is Network DoS Attack. As the Wireless Access Point creates a shared medium, it offers the possibility to flood the traffic of this medium toward the AP which will make its processing more slow toward the clients that attempt to connect. Such attacks can be created just by a ping flood DoS attack.

Pyloris is a popular DoS tool that you can download from − https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyloris/

Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC) is another popular tool for DoS attacks.

Quick Tips
To secure a wireless network, you should keep the following points in mind −

◇ Change the SSID and the network password regularly.

◇ Change the default password of access points.

◇ Don’t use WEP encryption.

◇ Turn off guest networking.

◇ Update the firmware of your wireless device.

If you want to enhance your knowledge and want to know the tricks and ways to hack the Wi-Fi password using Android device, then this article will help you. Lots of people are asking about how to hack Wi-Fi passwords using Android and whether it is possible or not. The straightforward answer is “yes” you can hack Wi-Fi passwords in Android devices using some tricks and tools (apps).

Before diving into our main topic about how to hack Wi-Fi passwords in Android phones, we first discuss some of the basic information about the type of Wi-Fi password security.

Types of Wi-Fi Password Security
There are primarily three different types of Wi-Fi password securities. These Wi-Fi securities are as follows:

Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP).
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA).
Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS).
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) Wi-Fi security is one of the most popular and widely used Wi-Fi securities in the entire world. However, this security is a most week and insecure as well. Someone can easily crack and hack such Wi-Fi security using Airmon tools from Kali Linux and Aircrack.

Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)
The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) Wi-Fi security is the improved and updated version of WEP Wi-Fi security system. This Wi-Fi security system was introduced in the year 2003. But an American hacker found a significant flaw in WPA security keys. Due to which it became easy to hack this Wi-Fi security. It is possible to crack any Wi-Fi password that has WPA security from an Android smartphone.

Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS)
Finally, the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is only the Wi-Fi security system that is not easy to hack and crack. However, in some cases, it is also found that this Wi-Fi security also gets hacked but requires high hacking skills. If someone uses WPS security, then it might be difficult to hack this security.

Method 1: Hacking Wi-Fi Password in Android using WIFI WPS WPA TESTER (without Rooting)
Wi-Fi WPS WPA TESTER is a popular Android app which is widely used for hacking Wi-Fi passwords. Wi-Fi WPS TESTER app hacks only those routers that connect with WPS router with limited features. Hacking Wi-Fi using this app is so easy and only requires follows few steps. The best part of this application is that you can use it without rooting your Android phone. You can also use this app on a rooted Android phone with some extra features.

Using this Android app, you can easily check the wireless security and strength of your router. If the router is not secure, then the WIFI WPS WPA TESTER app easily bypasses Wi-Fi password on your Android phone. After skipping the password, it connects the Android phone with the router without providing a password.

It takes few times to display all nearby Wi-Fi networks, including their details (such as password security types, network types, signal strength, etc.).
Choose a Wi-Fi network and tap on it you wish to hack. A pop-up screen appears with a pre-defined list of keys (PIN).
Tap on the key to start your hacking process.
The app tries several times to hack Wi-Fi with default keys and the most widely used Wi-Fi keys.
Wait for few minutes, and the Wi-Fi password will be hacked successfully.
Method 5: Hacking Wi-Fi password in Android using WPSAPP
WPSAPP is an all-in-one app that allows you to connect nearby Wi-Fi networks using an 8-digit PIN. The WPSAPP app makes easier and convenient to hack Wi-Fi password in both rooted and non-rooted Android phones. It applies several algorithms for generating random pins as well as some default pins. Using this app, you can hack any WEP Wi-Fi network without any difficulties.

When you scan for the networks, they appear with the red cross, question marks, and green tick marks. The red cross networks are secure, and their password is unknown. The networks showing with question marks have WPS protocol enabled, their pin is unknown, and the app allows testing them with a most common pin. Finally, the green ticks networks are WPS protocol enabled and their password known, and they can be connected.# wifi-snffing
